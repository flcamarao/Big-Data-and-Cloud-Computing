# Big-Data-and-Cloud-Computing
My repository of Big Data and Cloud Computing exercises from my MS Data Science program is a comprehensive resource for practicing my skills. It tracks my progress, identifies areas for improvement, and prepares me for future projects. It's a great reference for anyone interested in learning or reviewing big data and cloud computing concepts.
